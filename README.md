# UnityWorkshop

Welcome to the UnityWorkshop wiki! This project was created for the UCSD VR Club x HKN workshop on May 25th, 2018 by Justin Park. This project accompanies the slides made at: tinyurl.com/VRxHKN

The first half of the slides provides a basic intro into Unity, navigation, GameObjects, and Components. The second half provides the steps needed to create the game shown in the slides.

Within the master folder in assets contains the completed product, along with all the assets needed to get to that point (Identified with (Master) or Master in the title). In the root of the assets folder are all the raw assets needed, so students may follow along to complete the final product.

Anyone finding this repository may use these slides and accompanying project, assets, and code FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY, and with credit to Justin Park and Triton XR (Formerly VR Club).
